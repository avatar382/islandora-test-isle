# Overview: Optional ISLE Components

These ISLE components are optional, powerful, and are built to be modular such that they can be installed independently or can work together.

* [Automated Testing](automated-testing.md): Utilize and extend ISLE's test suite for use with your institution's repository.

* [Blazegraph](blazegraph.md): High-performance replacement triplestore for larger Fedora repositories.

* [Loc.gov Proxy](loc-proxy.md): Creates a local cache of Library of Congress standards to improve performance, especially during high-volume ingests.

* [Matomo](matomo.md): Usage analytics package.

* [TICK Stack](tickstack.md): A suite of open-source applications that are used together for the storing, visualization and monitoring of data (time series metrics) gathered from running systems.

* [Varnish](varnish.md): HTTP accelerator and caching designed for content-heavy dynamic web sites.

# Drupal Modules Matrix

Please find below a list of all Drupal & Islandora resources (modules, plugins, libraries etc) used to build the demo site `isle.localdomain`. Please review these files to catalogue and understand which Drupal and Islandora modules are used, enabled and where the software is pulled from. Because the number of modules is large and can change, ISLE maintainers are not keeping an active printed list but encourage users to pull these files, review modify and extend as they need during development phases. The maintainers of all git repos will have up to date versions posted along with more extensive lists of dependencies, warnings and readmes.

The [isle_islandora_installer.sh](https://github.com/Islandora-Collaboration-Group/ISLE-Drupal-Build-Tools/blob/master/isle_islandora_installer.sh) of the [ISLE-Drupal-Build-Tools](https://github.com/Islandora-Collaboration-Group/ISLE-Drupal-Build-Tools) repo uses the following:

  * [Drupal Core 7.x](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal)
